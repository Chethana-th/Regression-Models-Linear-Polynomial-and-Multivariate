# 📊 Regression Models: Linear, Polynomial, and Multivariate
A hands-on project demonstrating the implementation and comparison of Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Multivariate Regression models using real-world-inspired datasets.

📌 Project Overview
This project explores three types of regression models:

Predicting Canada's income over years using Linear Regression.

Predicting Ice Cream sales based on temperature using Polynomial Regression.

Predicting salary based on experience, test scores, and interview scores using Multivariate Regression.

The goal is to understand how different types of regression handle various kinds of relationships between features and targets.

Models Implemented
1. Linear Regression - Canada Income Prediction
Dataset: Year vs Income.
Objective: Predict future income based on year.
Key Techniques: Model fitting, prediction, residual analysis.

2. Polynomial Regression - Ice Cream Sales vs Temperature
Dataset: Temperature vs Ice Cream Sales.
Objective: Capture non-linear (curved) trends.
Key Techniques: Polynomial feature transformation, overfitting check.

3. Multivariate Regression - Salary Prediction
Dataset: Experience, Test Score, Interview Score vs Salary.
Objective: Predict salary based on multiple independent features.
Key Techniques: Multivariate analysis, feature importance.
